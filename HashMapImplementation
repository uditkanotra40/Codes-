Hashmap allows the null values and is not thread safe.
Hastable is threadsafe and does not allow null values

16 buckets are created which are nodes of the linked list.

we calculate the hashvalue of the key
hashcode(abc)=111011
Hashcode after an modular operation returns a index value
there in the index the value is stored.
A node in hashmap contains 4 things in the node,
1) hashcode
2) key
3) value
4) next pointer

in case of collision same index generated then one node will added and prev next pointer will point to it

in case the key is null then it would stored in the 0th bucket

GET operation
get(key):
in get operation the hashcode is generated for the key.
then this hashcode is looked up in the buckets if hashcode matches then value is matched and then and then the value is returnred
