Seraching in binary trees is O(log2n)
AVL tree comes into the play when binary tree is unbalnced
AVL is self balancing binary searach tree
AVL gurrentees that in worst case it would give us O(log2n)
every node in AVL has a balancing factor

balancing factor allowed value={-1,0,1}

solution of LL is R->(rotation)

solution of RR id L->(roation)
solution of LR is LR->(roation)
stop on first node whose balancing factor is voilated
